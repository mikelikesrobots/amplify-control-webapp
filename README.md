# Amplify Control Webapp

This package was generated by Vite. It can be used to deploy a webapp that will send MQTT messages to control a connected device, such as a ROS2 robot connected to IoT Core.

To build the package, use `npm` to install dependencies and build it.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

To set up Amplify and deploy it, some settings need to be changed. Open the [App.tsx](./src/App.tsx) file and modify AWSIoTProvider details to match your own region and endpoint. Then install the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/) and run the Amplify setup commands:

```bash
amplify init
amplify add auth hosting
amplify publish
```

You can also serve locally for development:

```bash
amplify serve
```
